# twitter_autobase
A Twitter bot that can read your DMs, then tweets like Twitter autobase. This project is a re-code of
[autodm_base](https://github.com/ydhnwb/autodm_base) by [Prieyudha Akadita S.](https://github.com/ydhnwb)
with many improvements and fixed bugs. You can try on my autobase account
[@autobase_reborn](https://twitter.com/autobase_reborn).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.x
- Twitter Developer Account
- Ngrok Account
- Heroku Account (optional)
 

## Getting Started
- Install [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/),
  [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), and [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)(optional)
- [Do Installation](#installation)
- Edit contents on config.py
- [Deploy to Heroku](#deploy-to-heroku)


## Installation
Open your terminal on the specified folder <br>
```bash
# download on https://github.com/fakhrirofi/twitter_autobase/releases for stable version
git clone https://github.com/fakhrirofi/twitter_autobase.git
cd twitter_autobase
```
Linux
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Windows
```
virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Make .gitignore file <br>
```
venv/
# add another, up to you
```
After modifying contents on config, run app by using syntax: `python3 app.py`


## Deploy to Heroku

### Deploy using Heroku CLI
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
heroku git:remote -a your_heroku_app_name
git push heroku master
```

### Heroku limitations
- 550 free dyno hours, you can upgrade to 1000 hours by adding credit card to your account.
- Dyno cycling (restart), so `add_admin`, `rm_admin`, `add_blacklist`, `rm_blacklist`,
`switch on/off`, and all temporary db won't work perfectly. It would be better if you use Heroku database services e.g. Postgres. Please setting `Blacklist_words`, `Admin_id`, and etc. before
deploying to Heroku. Database will be changed to Postgres in future updates.


## DMs examples (based on config)
You can tweet more than one media with media link on tweet. Open your twitter app then tap (hold) the tweet.
Media link automatically will be copied, then send the link to this bot from DM.

### Quote-retweet
`fess! your message https://twitter.com/username/1234567890?s=19` (by attaching media, url, or not)

### Make a thread
`fess! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.` (by attaching media, url, or not)

### Normal tweet
`fess! your message` (by attaching media, url, or not)

### Admin command
Note: Due to Heroku dyno cycling, some commands that use temporary data won't work perfectly. <br>
Only admin can access these commands. <br>
`/add_blacklist word1 word2 word-n` <br>
`/rm_blacklist word1 word2 word-n` <br>
`/display_blacklist` <br>
`/add_admin username1 username2 username-n` <br>
`/rm_admin username1 username2 username-n` <br>
`/who https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890?s=19` check who was sent the menfess <br>
`/switch off` turn off the automenfess <br>
`/switch on` turn on the automenfess <br>
`/block https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890?s=19` delete menfess & block user by attaching his menfess url <br>
`/unfoll https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890?s=19` delete menfess & unfoll user by attaching his menfess url <br><br>
For add_blacklist and rm_blacklist, you can add space into your words by giving underscore "_". Example: <br>
`/add_blacklist _word1_ word2_word3 word-n` <br>
This command will append " word1 ", "word2 word3", and "word-n" to Blacklist words list.

### User command
`/delete https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890?s=19` delete menfess by attaching tweet url <br>
`/unsend` delete the last menfess <br>
`/menu` send config.DMCmdMenu to sender <br>
`/cancel` cancel the last menfess when it's still on the queue


## Notes
- Admin passes all filters
- Only admin that can set account using admin command
- All temporary data only available for one day (reset at midnight or heroku dyno cycling)
- If you use github repository to deploy to heroku, make sure to set the repository to private.
- Keywords are not case-sensitive
- See changelogs on [releases's notes](https://github.com/fakhrirofi/twitter_autobase/releases)
- I have written documentation in config
